# Hotspot Dating App Backend

This is the backend for the Hotspot Dating App built using FastAPI. The app focuses on enabling users to connect with each other when they are within specified geofenced hotspot locations, making it an exciting way for people to meet in real-world locations such as cafes, restaurants, and other public spaces.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user registration and login.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles, including adding and prioritizing photos.
- **Hotspot Management**: Admins can create and manage hotspot locations where users can connect.
- **Geofencing**: Users can only interact with others when they are within a defined hotspot.
- **Swiping Mechanism**: Users can swipe right or left on other users and match if both swipe right.
- **Undo Swipe**: Users can undo their last swipe.
- **Matches**: Users are notified of matches when both parties swipe right on each other.

## Tech Stack

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.
- **PostgreSQL**: Advanced open source relational database.
- **Boto3**: AWS SDK for Python to interact with AWS services like S3.
